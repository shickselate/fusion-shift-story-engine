# BREAKING: Entire Research Team Lost After Ancient Signal Discovery

**DEEP STATION NYM** â€” A catastrophic psychic event has claimed the lives of an entire archaeological team after Archivist **Ash Doran** of the **Cult of Mirrors** received what officials are calling an "ancient signal of unknown origin" within the **plasma fields** surrounding this critical diplomatic hub.

The incident occurred during routine deep-space excavation work when Doran's team detected electromagnetic anomalies consistent with **pre-war civilization technology**. Sources within the station report that the signal triggered immediate **psychic interference**, causing crew members to exhibit erratic behaviour before losing all communication with the research vessel.

> "We watched their ship go dark on the sensors," said Station Commander **Maya Voss**. "Then the entire plasma field around them started... changing. The colours were wrong."

The loss comes at a particularly volatile time for **Deep Station Nym**, which has served as neutral ground for ongoing peace negotiations between warring factions. The station's unique position within the plasma field has made it a **strategic diplomatic outpost**, but recent territorial disputes have heightened tensions.

**Cult of Mirrors** leadership has classified all details about the signal's nature, though survivors from nearby vessels report seeing **strange geometric patterns forming in the plasma clouds** before the team's disappearance. The area has been declared a **no-fly zone** pending investigation.

This marks the **third unexplained incident** in the region this month, raising questions about the stability of the diplomatic negotiations.
