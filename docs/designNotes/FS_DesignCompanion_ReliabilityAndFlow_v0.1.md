# Fusion Shift – Design Companion: Reliability & Narrative Flow (v0.1)

> A companion to the core architecture document, this design note explores narrative reliability, story pacing, thread tracking, and creative structure in the Fusion Shift AI story engine.

---

## 🔁 1. Reliability & Story Queue Design

### Error Handling

**Goal**: Ensure graceful story generation even under uncertain inputs or model failure.

- **Prompt Fallbacks**: Drop subcomponents (quotes, rumours, flavour) if prompt structure breaks.
- **Narrative Simplification**: Fall back to a direct summary if LLM output is missing or malformed.
- **Light Validation**: Future plan to catch contradictions, tone mismatches, or missing characters.

---

### Asynchronous Story Queue

**Goal**: Avoid overwhelming players with too many events or repeated tones.

- **Queue System**:
  - Incoming events are timestamped and prioritised
  - Key metadata includes: `urgency`, `narrative_weight`, `expiry`
- **Pacing Engine**:
  - Throttles output during high-activity phases
  - Ensures tonal variation: e.g. avoid “three grim deaths in a row”
  - Prevents repetition of same event type in sequence

## 🧠 2. Narrative Memory & Thread Tracking

### Thread Tracker

**Purpose**: Maintain continuity and narrative arcs over time.

- Track open threads: unresolved espionage, wars, political tensions
- Tag when threads close (e.g. treaty signed, spy captured)
- Optional: build an interface to visualise active threads per character or faction

---

### Character Ledger

**Purpose**: Log individual character evolution for reuse in future stories.

- What they’ve done: battles, missions, discoveries
- Who they know: rivalries, alliances, romances
- Status markers: promoted, killed, mythologised

> This enables callbacks, emotional resonance, and emergent legendary arcs.

## 🎭 3. Narrative Modes by Event Type

This system supports a variety of tones and perspectives per event.

| Event Type       | Possible Narrative Formats                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `battle`         | News dispatch, admiral's log, heroic epic           |
| `espionage`      | Spy dossier, intercepted message, tavern rumour     |
| `marriage`       | Diplomatic preamble, wedding speech, scandal column |
| `expansion`      | Settler’s diary, imperial announcement              |
| `coronation`     | Public address, mythic prophecy, religious rite     |
| `catastrophe`    | Emergency alert, survivor journal, requiem          |
| `discovery`      | Science log, explorer’s voice recording             |

> Each template has a tone range: `serious`, `intimate`, `tabloid`, `grand`, etc.

## 💡 4. Future Player-Controlled Narrative Customisation

- Allow players to select preferred **narrative voice** for their empire  
  (e.g. “Stoic Historians”, “Gossiping Courtiers”, “Brutalist Realists”)

- Let players **name their characters** and **set a tone bias**  
  (e.g. “Make Rika Kael always sound brave, even in defeat”)

- Enable **co-authoring**: offer players a short choice or rewrite on major events  
  (like a choose-your-own-newsroom)

## 🎯 5. Design Intent

This story engine is not just a utility — it's a **living character** in the game.

- It listens, remembers, and creates context.
- It gives meaning to systems and emotion to stats.
- It encourages players to care about what unfolds — not just who wins.

The tone should be:
- Lightly poetic  
- Occasionally dry or ironic  
- Capable of myth, sc
