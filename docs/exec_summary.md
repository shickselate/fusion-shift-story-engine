# Executive Summary

**Fusion Shift: Story Engine** is an AI-powered narrative system for a multiplayer space strategy game.  
It transforms gameplay events — battles, diplomacy, espionage — into rich, character-driven stories, news feeds, and cinematic prompts.

Built to make the galaxy feel alive, the engine:

- Reacts to real-time player decisions
- Creates memorable characters and faction arcs
- Generates immersive text and media-ready prompts
- Scales to support dynamic alliances, betrayals, and world history

Its modular architecture turns structured game data into emotionally resonant narrative — giving players a reason to care about every decision.

This is more than flavour text. It’s a living chronicle of a shared galaxy.
